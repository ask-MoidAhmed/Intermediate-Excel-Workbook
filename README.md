## üìã Overview

This project simulates a **full data pipeline for a company** using an Excel workbook that mimics a **relational database**. The workbook contains multiple linked sheets: Customers, Orders, Products, Inventory, Departments, Staff, Shipments, Returns, Reviews, Tracking, and more. It integrates dynamic calculations, validation checks, and cross-referenced keys using **XLOOKUPs, helper columns, and structured tables** to maintain data integrity and support scalable analysis.

## üîß Steps Completed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Planning & Design

- **Created an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram):**
  - Designed relationships between key tables (Customers, Orders, Products, etc.).
  - Used [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/dn) with **DBML code** to build a crows foot ERD for clear schema planning.

- **Mapped keys and relationships:**
  - Added **foreign keys (FKs)** to connect tables.
  - Set up **primary keys (PKs)** for easy reference and validation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Workbook Setup

- **Created worksheets:**
  - Customers, Orders, Products, Inventory, Departments, Staff, Shipments, Returns, Reviews, Tracking, Replenishments.

- **Defined structured tables:**
  - Added clear **table names** for use in formulas & references.
  - Populated initial data using ChatGPT for speed and accuracy.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Inventory Logic

- **Dynamic Inventory Calculation:**
  - Added a **helper column** for Starting Inventory.
  - Used formulas to calculate:
    ```
    Actual Inventory = Starting Inventory - Quantity + Refund + Replenishment
    ```

- **Tested replenishment:**
  - Verified that updates to replenishment **dynamically update inventory** totals.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Orders & Payment

- **Order Details:**
  - Added Orders & Order Details tables with:
    - Dynamic **Total Price** calculation (auto-updating).
    - Tax & Shipping logic:
      - Free shipping on orders ‚â• $75.
      - 7% discount on orders ‚â• $140.

  - Added **validation check cells:**
    - Ensured that Product ID & Order ID matched in Returns.
    - Showed **‚ÄúValid‚Äù / ‚ÄúInvalid‚Äù** indicators.
  - Return price auto-updates or shows `N/A` if validation fails.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Address & Tracking

- **Shipping Addresses:**
  - Linked Ship Address to Customer ID as an FK.
  - Ensured **Orders table validates** Customer ID to maintain referential integrity.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Helper Columns & Analysis Prep

- Added **helper columns**:
  - Extracted *Year* & *Month* from key dates to enable time-based analysis.

- **Initial testing:**
  - Ran through data pipelines to confirm relationships & calculations hold under changes.
