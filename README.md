# üóÇ Excel SQL Data Pipeline (Intermediate‚ÄìAdvanced Level)

## üìã Overview

This project demonstrates a **hybrid data pipeline** that begins with a multi-sheet Excel workbook designed to simulate a **relational database**. The workbook includes interconnected tables‚ÄîCustomers, Orders, Products, Inventory, Departments, Staff, Shipments, Returns, Reviews, Tracking, and more‚Äîeach linked through cross-referenced keys and maintained with **XLOOKUPs, helper columns, structured tables, and data validation**.

As Excel reaches its practical limits in querying and analyzing complex, interrelated datasets, the workflow transitions to **SQL-based analysis**. By importing the Excel tables into a relational database environment (e.g., MySql), I use **JOINs, aggregations, filtering, and conditional logic** to perform more scalable and efficient analysis. This shift highlights the strengths of each tool and mirrors real-world data handling practices in business intelligence and analytics.

## üîß Steps Completed

### Planning & Design

- **Created an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram):**
  - Designed relationships between key tables (Customers, Orders, Products, etc.).
  - Used [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/dn) with **DBML code** to build a crows foot ERD for clear schema planning.

- **Mapped keys and relationships:**
  - Added **foreign keys (FKs)** to connect tables.
  - Set up **primary keys (PKs)** for easy reference and validation.

### Workbook Setup

- **Created worksheets:**
  - Customers, Orders, Products, Inventory, Departments, Staff, Shipments, Returns, Reviews, Tracking, Replenishments.

- **Defined structured tables:**
  - Added clear **table names** for use in formulas & references.
  - Populated initial data using ChatGPT for speed and accuracy.

---

### Inventory Logic

- **Dynamic Inventory Calculation:**
  - Added a **helper column** for Starting Inventory.
  - Used formulas to calculate:
    ```
    Actual Inventory = Starting Inventory - Quantity + Refund + Replenishment
    ```

- **Tested replenishment:**
  - Verified that updates to replenishment **dynamically update inventory** totals.

---

### Orders & Payment

- **Order Details:**
  - Added Orders & Order Details tables with:
    - Dynamic **Total Price** calculation (auto-updating).
    - Tax & Shipping logic:
      - Free shipping on orders ‚â• $75.
      - 7% discount on orders ‚â• $140.
     
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d67be50a-5467-4ebe-8462-b6e99a41fc7b)

  - Used **named cells** to manage thresholds and keep logic flexible.

- **Payment & Validation:**
  - Set up Payment table.
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/511da847-3332-47e2-a59d-df081245a542)

  - Added **validation check cells:**
    - Ensured that Product ID & Order ID matched in Returns.
    - Showed **‚ÄúValid‚Äù / ‚ÄúInvalid‚Äù** indicators.
  - Return price auto-updates or shows `N/A` if validation fails.

---

### Address & Tracking

- **Shipping Addresses:**
  - Linked Ship Address to Customer ID as an FK.
  - Ensured **Orders table validates** Customer ID to maintain referential integrity.
